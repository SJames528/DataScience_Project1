There are two seperate reports, one for our python code and one for R. These are titled "CombinedPythonCode.ipynb" and "wiresharkRfile.Rmd" respectively. 
Please download the files on your computer and make sure there are all in the same folder. 

PYTHON
In order to run the python code you need to change the working directory into the place where you saved the files. You can do it by changing the ... line of "CombinedPythonCode.ipynb". 
The working directory needs to be changed for "wiresharkanalysis.ipynb" as well. 

Make sure you saved the following text files in the same working directory:
-listofcountries.txt
-reducedmyv4IPs.txt
-ip.txt
-GeoIP.dat
-GeoLiteCity.dat
wiresharkdata.csv

RStudio
The R Markdown file and the "wireshark.csv" file should be saved in the same folder.
