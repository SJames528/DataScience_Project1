## Overview
<p>In our GitHub repo there are two seperate reports, one for our python code and one for R. These are titled "CombinedPythonCode.ipynb" and "wiresharkRfile.Rmd" respectively. Also included on the home page are any sources of data which we used in our analysis. These will need to be in one folder, which is referenced at the start of CombinedPythonCode.ipynb</p>

## Equity Agreement
<p>We have agreed on one third equity for all members of the group.</p> 

### PYTHON
In order to run the python code you need to change the working directory into the place where you saved the files.
The working directory needs to be changed for "wiresharkanalysis.ipynb" as well. 

Make sure you saved the following text files in the same working directory:
-reducedmyv4IPs.txt
-ip.txt
-GeoIP.dat
-GeoLiteCity.dat
-wiresharkdata.csv

### RStudio
The R Markdown file and the "wireshark.csv" file should be saved in the same folder.
